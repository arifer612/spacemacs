#+begin_example shell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs %appdata%/.emacs.d

* Introduction
Spacemacs is a new way of experiencing Emacs -- it's a sophisticated and
polished set-up, focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.

Just clone and launch it, then press the space bar to explore the
interactive list of carefully-chosen key bindings. You can also press
the home buffer's =[?]= button for some great first key bindings to try.

Spacemacs can be used naturally by both Emacs and Vim users -- you can
even mix the two editing styles. Being able to quickly switch between
input styles, makes Spacemacs a great tool for pair-programming.

Spacemacs is currently in beta, and any contributions are very welcome.
