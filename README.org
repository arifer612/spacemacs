* Introduction
Spacemacs is a new way of experiencing Emacs -- it's a sophisticated and
polished set-up, focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.

Just clone and launch it, then press the space bar to explore the interactive
list of carefully-chosen key bindings. You can also press the home buffer's =[?]=
button for some great first key bindings to try.

Spacemacs can be used naturally by both Emacs and Vim users -- you can even mix
the two editing styles. Being able to quickly switch between input styles, makes
Spacemacs a great tool for pair-programming.

Spacemacs is currently in beta, and any contributions are very welcome.

#+CAPTION: spacemacs_python
[[file:doc/img/spacemacs-python.png]]

* Features

- *Great documentation:* access the Spacemacs documentation with ~SPC h SPC~.
- *Beautiful GUI:* you'll love the distraction free UI and its functional
  mode-line.
- *Excellent ergonomics:* all the key bindings are accessible by pressing the
  space bar or ~Alt-m~.
- *Mnemonic key bindings:* commands have mnemonic prefixes like ~SPC b~ for all
  the buffer commands or ~SPC p~ for the project commands.
- *Batteries included:* discover hundreds of ready-to-use packages nicely
  organised in configuration layers following a set of [[SpaceDevCons][conventions]].

* Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available for each layer by pressing ~SPC h SPC~.

You can also check the [[SpaceDevDocs][general documentation]], [[SpaceDevGuide][quick start guide]] and the [[SpaceDevFAQ][FAQ]].

* Getting Help
If you need help, ask your question in the [[SpacemacsGitter][Gitter Chat]] and a member of the
community will help you out.

If you prefer IRC, connect to the [[IRCGitter][Gitter Chat IRC server]] and join the
=#syl20bnr/spacemacs= channel.

Last but not least there are a lot of high class tutorials available on YouTube:
- Jack of Some's Spacemacs related channel [[JackOfSomeYouTube][here]]
- GDQuest's Game Design oriented tutorials to Spacemacs [[GDQuestYouTube][here]]
- Practicalli's Clojure tutorials based on Spacemacs [[PracticalliYouTube][here]]
- Eivind Fonn's classic Spacemacs ABC: [[EivindFonnYouTube][here]]

* Prerequisites
Spacemacs is an extension of a popular text editor called Emacs. Thus you need
to first install base Emacs and then download the Spacemacs extension files with
Git.

** Emacs
Spacemacs requires Emacs 27.1 or above. The development version of Emacs is not
/officially/ supported, but it should nevertheless be expected to work.

Some modes require third-party tools that you'll have to install via your
favorite package manager.

*** Linux distros
Install the =emacs= package with your linux distributions package manager.

Do not install the =xemacs= package. It's not supported by Spacemacs. XEmacs is
an old fork of Emacs. The X in its name is unrelated to X11.

Emacs has graphical support.

*Note:*

Some linux distributions support only Emacs versions older than 27.1. In this
case you should [[BuildFromSourceManual][build from source]] instead.

*** macOS
**** Install emacs
***** Using emacs-plus
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus

# to install Emacs 27
brew install emacs-plus@27 --with-spacemacs-icon
# or to install Emacs 28
brew install emacs-plus@28 --with-spacemacs-icon

brew link emacs-plus
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** Using emacs-mac
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
brew install emacs-mac
brew link emacs-mac
#+END_EXAMPLE

***** Using cask
Homebrew now recommends to use the cask version with the following message:
"Please try the Cask for a better-supported Cocoa version". To install the cask
version:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
brew install --cask emacs
#+END_EXAMPLE

This installs a pre-built package from https://emacsformacosx.com/

***** Other ways
If you're not comfortable with the ways mentioned above, then [[MacosxInstallEmacs][EmacsWiki]] lists
down a few ways to install Emacs for macOS.

**** Install Source Code Pro font
Once Emacs is installed, run the following commands in the terminal to install
the default Source Code Pro font:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
  brew install --cask font-source-code-pro
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Install Spacemacs
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Notes:*

It's also recommended to add the [[SpaceDevLayersOSX][osx layer]] to your [[SpaceDevDotfile][dotfile]] after completing the
Spacemacs [[#install][install process]]. Instructions on how to do so are available in the
documentation for the [[SpaceDevLayersOSX][osx layer]].

Depending on the installed version of GnuTLS, securely installing Emacs packages
may fail. In this case, it is possible to install using =emacs --insecure=.
However, be aware that this means your packages will be transferred using http,
use at your own risk.

You may also have some issues when searching for your projects. It is
recommended to install the GNU [[RipgrepHomebrew][ripgrep]] through homebrew:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  brew install ripgrep
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Windows
Download the official 64-bit (x86_64) stable builds from the [[WindowsInstallEmacs][GNU FTP]].

You'll also need =gzip= and put it in your path. Download it from the [[WindowsInstallGzip][GNUWin32
project page]]

**** Install Spacemacs in Windows
By default, Emacs looks for the =.emacs.d= directory in:
=C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming=

- Clone Spacemacs to the Roaming directory:

  - Windows Command Prompt:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs %appdata%/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

  - Windows PowerShell prompt:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs $env:appdata/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

- Or if a =HOME= environment variable has been configured that points to your user
  directory: =C:\Users\<username>=

  Clone Spacemacs to the =<username>= directory:

  - Windows Command Prompt:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs %homepath%/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

  - Windows PowerShell prompt:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE powershell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs $home/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Notes
- If the following error occurs after starting Emacs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE 
  The directory ~/.emacs.d/server is unsafe
#+END_EXAMPLE

  Fix it by changing the owner of the directory =~/.emacs.d/server=:

  - From Properties select the Tab "Security",
  - Select the button "Advanced",
  - Select the Tab "Owner"
  - Change the owner to your account name

  Source: [[WindowsEmacsServerError][Stack Overflow]]

- For efficient searches, we recommend installing [[RipgrepGithub][ripgrep]].

- Depending on the installed version of GnuTLS, securely installing Emacs
  packages may fail. In this case it is possible to install using =emacs
  --insecure=. However be aware that this means your packages will be
  transferred using http, use at your own risk.

- The period (dot) before a file or folder name means that it's a hidden file or
  folder. To show hidden files and folders:

  - Press the Windows key
  - Type =File explorer options=
  - Select the =View= tab at the top
  - Check =Show hidden files, folders and drives=
  - Click =OK=

* Install
** Default installation
1. If you have an existing Emacs configuration, back it up first by running the
   following code in your terminal:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  cd ~
  mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.bak
  mv .emacs .emacs.bak
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Don't forget to backup and /remove/ the =~/.emacs= file. Otherwise Spacemacs *WILL
   NOT* be able to load. This is because that file will prevent Emacs from
   loading the proper initialization file.

2. Clone the repository with [[GitDownload][Git]]:

   *Note: Windows users*, see [[#install-spacemacs-in-windows][Windows section]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Or in case you have a limited internet connection or speed,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_EXAMPLE

3. (Optional) Install the default fonts

   It's recommended to install [[SourceCodeProGithub][Source Code Pro]] by Adobe as the default font. It
   ensures that, for example, the symbols on the mode-line (bottom bar) looks
   correct. It's also recommended to use a "Fallback font". These depend on the
   system:

   - GNU/Linux: /NanumGothic/ (package named /fonts-nanum/ on Debian,
     for example)
   - macOS: /Arial Unicode MS/
   - Windows: /MS Gothic/ or /Lucida Sans Unicode/

   If the mode-line doesn't look similar to the [[#introduction][picture at the top of this page]],
   make sure you have the correct fallback font installed.

   If you're running in a terminal, then you'll also need to change the
   terminal's font settings.

4. Launch Emacs. Spacemacs will automatically install the packages it
   requires.

5. Once the packages are installed, answer the questions in the Dotfile wizard
   installer. If you are new to Emacs and Spacemacs, then it's fine to just
   accept the default choices. It's easy to try the other choices later, without
   having to reinstall Spacemacs. They can be changed in the dotfile
   =~/.spacemacs=.

6. After answering the questions, Spacemacs will download and install the
   remaining packages it will require. When the all the packages have been
   installed, restart Emacs to complete the installation.

*Notes:* If you are behind a firewall or similar and you get an error regarding
package downloads then you may try to disable the HTTPS protocol by starting
Emacs with

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
emacs --insecure
#+END_EXAMPLE

but this should be a last resort because of the security implications.

You can set the =dotspacemacs-elpa-https= variable to =nil= in your dotfile
=~/.spacemacs= but this has the same security implications as the insecure flag.
You may also want to clear out your =.emacs.d/elpa= directory before doing this,
so that any corrupted packages you may have downloaded will be re-installed.

=error: Package 'package-build-' is unavailable= may occur due to heavy network
taffic. You can fix it by setting the =dotspacemacs-elpa-timeout= variable to
=70= in your dotfile.

=Warning (bytecomp)= and other compilation warnings are perfectly normal. If
you're curious, you can find out why these occur [[QuelpaBytecompWarning][here]].

If the mode-line turns red, then be sure to consult the [[SpaceDevFAQ][FAQ]].

** Alternative installations
Currently, there are two supported locations for you to place your Spacemacs
configuration files.

*** Modify HOME environment variable
This solution is ideal for quickly trying Spacemacs without compromising your
existing configuration. Clone Spacemacs outside the Emacs dotdirectory
=~/.emacs.d= and modify the HOME environment variable.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  mkdir ~/spacemacs
  git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs.git ~/spacemacs/.emacs.d
  HOME=~/spacemacs Emacs
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Note*: If you're using the Fish shell, then you'll need to modify the last
command to: =env HOME=$HOME/spacemacs Emacs=

*** Modify spacemacs-start-directory variable
This solution is better suited to "embed" Spacemacs into your own configuration.
If you've cloned Spacemacs into =~/.emacs.d/spacemacs/=, then drop the following
lines in the =~/.emacs.d/init.el= file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE elisp
  (setq spacemacs-start-directory "~/.emacs.d/spacemacs/")
  (load-file (concat spacemacs-start-directory "init.el"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Spacemacs logo
For Linux users, create =spacemacs.desktop= in =~/.local/share/applications/=
using [[LinuxSpacemacsDesktopFile][this .desktop file]] as a reference. Change the =Name= parameter to
=Name=Spacemacs= and the =Icon= parameter to
=Icon=/PATH/TO/EMACSD/core/banners/img/spacemacs.png= where =PATH/TO/EMACSD= is
the path to your =.emacs.d= directory, usually =~/.emacs.d= or
=~/.config/emacs=.

For macOS users, you need to [[SpacemacsLogoIcon][download the .icns version of the logo]] and simply
[[MacosxChangeIcon][change the logo on the Dock]].

* Update
Spacemacs supports two different update schemes, the default is a rolling update
scheme based on the latest version of packages available. This version can be
found on the =develop= branch and is updated by a simple git pull.

The second method is deprecated. It was a fixed version scheme which was based
on a stable set of packages. The latest fixed version can be found on the
=master= branch and would show a notification when a new version is available.
Be warned that this method has not been updated in a long time, so packages will
be very old.

** Rolling update (on develop)
1. Close Emacs and update the git repository:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
  git pull --rebase
#+END_EXAMPLE

2. Restart Emacs to complete the upgrade.

** Deprecated automatic update (on master branch)
When a new version is available, a little arrow will appear in the mode-line.

Its color depends on the number of versions that have been released since the
last update. Green means that you have a recent version, orange and red means
that you have an older version.

#+CAPTION: powerline_update
[[file:doc/img/powerline-update.png]]

Click on the arrow to update Spacemacs to the latest version.

** Manual update (on master branch)
Remove the =<= and =>= angle brackets when you're typing the lines below into
your shell. Make sure to also replace the text: "tag version which you are
updating to" with a tagged version. This page lists the [[SpacemacsGithubTags][latest tags]]

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
git fetch
git reset --hard <tag version which you are updating to>
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Revert to a specific version (on master branch)
To revert to a specific version, just checkout the corresponding branch. For
instance, the following command reverts Spacemacs to version =0.200=:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE shell
git checkout origin/release-0.200
#+END_EXAMPLE

*After updating Spacemacs (either manually or automatically), you should also
check if any updates are available for your packages. On the Spacemacs Home
Buffer ~SPC b h~, click (press ~RET~) on the =[Update Packages]= button, or use
the convenient keybinding ~SPC f e U~ *

* Quotes
[[AshnurQuote][Quote]] by [[AshnurGithub][ashnur]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
«I feel that spacemacs is an aircraft carrier and I am playing table tennis
on the deck as a freerider.»
#+END_EXAMPLE

[[DeuillQuote][Quote]] by [[DeuillGithub][deuill]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
«I LOVE SPACEMACS AND MAGIT

 That is all»
#+END_EXAMPLE
